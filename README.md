# pvs2d
A library focusing on implementing Potentially-Visible Sets in 2d.  
The reason for creating this library is to focus on read-ability and portability (written in C => can be binded to anything).  
In the future, there will be a demo that uses it in 3d rendering.  
_The work is still in progress_
